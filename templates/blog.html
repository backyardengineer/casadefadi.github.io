            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>My name is Fadi Ghanim, born in Baghadad, Iraq summer of 1996. After much chaos back home from war violence, my family decided to flee after various life threatening threats. Few years after leaving Iraq, we
                found asylum in southern California in 2008. From then on, I considered southern California my new home
                and have been living here ever since. I learned english going to middle school as a seven grader, through high school and successfully made it to a four year university. </p>
            <p>I decided to become an engineer after the curiosity of how things work haunted me everyday of senior year of high school. From how atoms collide to how a block of magnesium alloy with pistons can move a 2 ton vehicle.</p>
            <p>As every engineer's ultimate goal, my ultimate goal is to  work for NASA on the next project to advance space exploration. </p>
            <p>In five years (summer 2016) I see myself have graduated from San Diego State University and working as a full time engineer for an engineering firm to build up my resume and expereince.
                Within the next five years, I should be getting ready to start my masters program in a subject that will hopefully become more clear to me as I begin working in the enineering field.</p>
